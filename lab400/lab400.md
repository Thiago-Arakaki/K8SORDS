*NOTE*: Wercker configuration file is written in YAML, a structured, text-based language which is often used for configuration files. If you are not familiar with YAML, see YAML syntax (http://devcenter.wercker.com/docs/wercker-yml/yaml-syntax), or the official YAML reference card (http://www.yaml.org/refcard.html).

In the next steps we are going to configure a wercker.yml file from scratch, every step bellow demands that you paste informations into the wercker.yml file and commit it.

Wercker is a tool that is integrated with your github, so every commit that you make will trigger the application workflow.


### Building our application steps
1. Build:
The build step is responsible for creating the container image for your application, copy the code bellow and add it to your wercker.yml file

```
box: 
# The image that is going to be used as base image for our application
  id: node:latest
    
build:
  steps:
# The code bellow is about getting our application nodejs dependencies installed on our container.
# To see the references for other languages, please refer to: https://devcenter.wercker.com/quickstarts/languages/
    - npm-install
    - npm-test
    - script:
        name: echo nodejs information
        # Here we are declaring an environment variable to use it latter in our application
        code: |
          export DBURI=$DBURI
          echo $DBURI
          echo "node version $(node -v) running"
          echo "npm version $(npm -v) running"
```

Now get back to the Wercker page and access the Envionment tab, to set our DBURI variable and click in Add:

2. Push:

The push step is responsible to push our newly created image to Oracle Container Image Registy. Copy the code bellow and paste it on our wercker.yml file.
```diff
-Please respect the spaces, yaml is a language based on identation- 
```
```
push:
  steps:
    - internal/docker-push:
            entrypoint: node index.js
            working-dir: $WERCKER_ROOT
            tag: $WERCKER_GIT_COMMIT
            ports: "80"
            username: $DOCKER_USERNAME
            password: $OCI_AUTH_TOKEN
            repository: $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$DOCKER_REPO
```

Now back to the wercker console, click on the environment tab and add the following environment variables:
